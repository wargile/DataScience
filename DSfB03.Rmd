3. Introduction to Predictive Modeling: From Correlation to Supervised Segmentation
Fundamental concepts: Identifying informative attributes; Segmenting data by progressive attribute selection.
Exemplary techniques: Finding correlations; Attribute/variable selection; Tree induction.
Models, Induction, and Prediction
Supervised Segmentation
Selecting Informative Attributes
Example: Attribute Selection with Information Gain
Supervised Segmentation with Tree-Structured Models
Visualizing Segmentations
Trees as Sets of Rules
Probability Estimation
Example: Addressing the Churn Problem with Tree Induction
Summary
